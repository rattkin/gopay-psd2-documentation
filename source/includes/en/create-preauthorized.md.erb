## Pre-authorized payment

Via the credit card, you can block the payment for 4 days using the pre-authorization. Pre-authorized payment can be created by setting of a parameter ```preauthorization``` to ```true```.

Blocked funds can be [partially received](#partial-charge-of-pre-authorized-payment) or [received in full amount](#charge-of-pre-authorization) by API calling.

For unblok funds it is necessary to make API [calling of cancellation](#cancellation-of-pre-authorization) of the pre-authorized payment.
